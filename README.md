# Astec test work

I used pure node.js because I didn't want to overload the repo with unnecessary packages like babel.js.
Therefore, you can run this script in your terminal.

### Expected operation

- iterate through pre-defined activeModules array
- find the largest number in module names
- return the largest number (which is 11 in this test case)
- export returned number to unit test

### Usage after cloning

- npm install
- npm start

### Unit test

- npm test
